    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This 4-ingredient orange chicken made with frozen chicken tenders is great for when you’re craving takeout. It’s so simple to make at home, is very budget-friendly, and only takes 4 ingredients. I serve it over rice, topped with green onions and sesame seeds.</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs; mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
        <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
        <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
